# C# Self-Learning Notes

## Overview
This repository contains my code snippets, exercises, and personal notes taken while learning C# fundamentals. 

## Source Material
The structure and content are based on the **Learn C# Programming – Full Course with Mini-Projects** video by FreeCodeCamp.org.
* **Original Video:** [Watch here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrtFtdTTfv0)

## Project Structure
I have organized the code into separate C# files (sections) to focus on specific concepts:
* **01_Hello_World.cs**; Setup, Main method, and basic output.
* **02_Variables_types.cs**; Data types (int, double, decimal), strict typing rules, and casting.
* **03_Operators.cs**; Math operators, increment/decrement (`++`), and modulo logic.
* **04_Control_Flow.cs**; User input, `if/else` logic, and `switch` statements.
* **05_Loops.cs**; `for` loops, `while` loops, and the FizzBuzz exercise.


## Disclaimer
This is a personal study aid, **not** a 1:1 transcription of the course. 
* I have modified it a tiny bit to better fit my workflow.
* I have focused on the specific exercises and syntax rules I want to remember.
* This repository is not intended to replace the original tutorial.
